This repository includes tutorials created by Dr. Lisa Winter to help
undergraduate students in the University of Colorado's Solar and
Space Physics REU program learn Python.

Both an iPython Notebook and Python code are supplied to read sunspot
data from the internet, plot the data, and perform a simple analysis
(Gaussian fitting) to find out how long solar cycles last.
